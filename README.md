#This repository was made for a final project in ERHS 535 in fall 2020. 

#The overarching question of the made dashboard is How does county classification (frontier, rural, or urban) effect COVID cases?

#Data Sources:

#Two datasets were used to create this dashboard. New York Times: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv

#Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) COVID-19 County Level Open Data Repository : https://data-cdphe.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cdphe-covid19-county-level-open-data-repository

#The New York Times database was used to obtain number of COVID-19 cases and deaths by day per Colorado county and to find daily new cases and deaths. The CDPHE database was also used to data on COVID-19 rates per 100,000 by county and hospitalization data by county.
